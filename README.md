# personal linux ricer for ubuntu server

i'm too lazy to set up a server that i break over and over again

## usage and prerequisites
- curl needs to be installed, if not you can install it with `sudo apt install curl`

if that's done use curl to download the script and run it as sudo

todo: make sure this is correct:
```bash
  curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laszloekovacs/linux-ricer/refs/heads/main/install.sh -o rice.sh && ./rice.sh
```

### stuff i want to include
- bspwm - window manager
- sxhkd - key bindings
- rofi - launcher
- polybar - status bar
- xorg - x server
